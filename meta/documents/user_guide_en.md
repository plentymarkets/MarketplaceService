## Plugin configuration
 
After installing the plugin, open the configuration by clicking on its name. Do not change the route in the **Webhook URL** tab. If you change it here, you must change the corresponding part of the **webhookURL** in your service plugin's plugin JSON.

Furthermore, enter the **IDs** of the users you want to have access to the tickets created when a customer purchases your service. You can find a user's ID by going to **System » Settings » User » Accounts** and clicking on the user's name.

**Save** the settings.
